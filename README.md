# Qured tech task - Jake King-Lee

This is my submission of the Qured tech task.

I started this project by using my own Flutter app template from my Github repos. My Flutter app template is a handy way of starting a new project with some basic tools and plugins that I commonly use.

I like to use `stacked` architecture and state management in my apps as I find it easy to use and has less boilerplate than solutions like `bloc`.


Tools used:
  - Flutter
  - Json Placeholder: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
  - Random Users: https://xsgames.co/randomusers/
  - Lorum Picsum: https://picsum.photos/

UI Design:
I wanted to create a sleek, minimalist UI because I think it suits a blog app and because it is quick and easy.

Things I would like to improve on:
  - Display an avatar image for each Comment in the PostDetailView
  - Possibly add more colour to draw the users eye to key elements (call to action buttons, etc.)
  - Add more unit tests.
  - Add more widget tests.
